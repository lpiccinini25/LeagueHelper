1. The possible audiences for my project are League of Legends players, and gamers in general.
The more specific audience I've landed on are serious gamers, looking to improve at the game. Competitive individuals, no goofing around.

2.
  1. Tips on how to improve
  2. Insights on their gameplay weaknesses
  3. Ways to track improvement
  4. Easy to access statistics
  5. View trends in their gameplay
  6. Compare themselves to other players
  7. Keep themselves accountable
  8. Keep Notes on games
  9. Set Goals which can be displayed and measured
  10. Save games for later viewing

  1. Tips on how to improve - A project that is able to deduce weaknesses in someones game
  2. Compare themselves to other players - A project that displays information comparing different people's accounts to see who is the best
  3. Set Goals which can be displayed and measured - A project that allows players to create their own goals, and then hold themselves accountable game to game
  to see how they are doing.

  1. I could find certain stats which are big determinants of ingame success, and then suggest gameplay tips to help them improve those stats which they are deficient in.
  Games would be fetched using an API, and I can hardcore important stats and tips.
  Players could be referenced to youtube videos expanding upon important concepts and ideas.

  2. Using an API I can find stats from the last 20 games or so of two different players and then compare key stats to see which player is performing better overall.
  If people are interested in just a couple different stats, then they can specify which stats they want to compare specifically.
  Not just one, but multiple different people can be compared at once, so you can see who is best at a certain thing in a group.

  3. Using a Log in based system, players can log in to a personalized account and set goals for themselves. Then their last 20 or so games can be fetched, and player will be
  allowed to assess how well their did at attaining those goals.
  Maybe this process can be automated. For example, people set a specific CS threshold they want to meet each game, and failing and succeeding to meet this goal game to game will
  be automatically tracked and measured.
  Additionally, players can make on specific games, like things they did well / bad at, so they can track new issues or goals. 

5. The winner of this process was idea 3, "Set Goals which can be displayed and measured"
