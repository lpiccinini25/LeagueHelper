**LeagueHelper**
Built a full-stack iOS app with SwiftUI, Firebase, and the Riot Games API that lets users track League of Legends performance, set goals, and take notes tied to their Riot account. Added features like user authentication, match history integration, and goal tracking. Used SwiftUI state management and Firebase's real-time data updates to keep user stats and match data in sync.
