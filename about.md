Welcome to LeagueHelper! The app that helps you structure and track your improvement on self-assigned goals!

Roles: This app was entirely done by me, so I filled all roles, from API, to database, to conceptual and style.

Audience: The audience of this app is experienced League of Legends players. This app does not provide any game tips outside of 
what can be derived from simple statistics. Instead, this app is designed to help people who already know what they need to improve
on structure and track their improvement.

When Testing:
I recommend using the account llimeincoconut#0000 (my account) for testing purposes. Also the Api Key needs to be updated everyday, so let me know when you are testing so I can update it, usually respond pretty fast. quantitative goals are auto evaluated while normals goals needs to be evaluated by user.
