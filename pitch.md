1. My audience member is someone who is looking for a way to improve at their favorite game, League of Legends. They are already somewhat knowledgeable on the game,
and know core fundamentals. At this point, they just need a tool to help them improve the mechanics and concepts they already know, and keep track of their improvement
or lack thereof.

2. 
One idea from preliminary Ideation I explored was an app which helped give players new tips. However, this is both very difficult because it would require me to an a large
amount of research on different gameplay ideas, it also doesn't properly address the main concern of my audience member, which is just tracking how well they are attaining
self-made goals. 
Another idea is comparing accounts, but this idea doesn't do a good job of helping people improve at the game, just tells barebones contextless statistics
about parts of their game in relation to other players. This doesn't help people improve, just tells themt they are bad.
My last idea was a app which allows players to set their own goals, and enables the creation of notes and annotations
on already player games to leave observations about their gameplay. This idea best matches the needs of my inspiration audience member, because it allows for self-made personal goals
which the attainment of such can be tracked using the apps features.

3. The final app I've decided to do is the last one mentioned, which allows people to add comments to games, set their own goals, and then track how well they are attaining these goals.
